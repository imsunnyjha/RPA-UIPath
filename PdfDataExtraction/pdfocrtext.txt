He looks so confused and grateful I know he won't mind if I excuse
myself and hurly off.
I'm wrong. As I move past him he suddenly looks desperate again and
grabs my arm.
Oh, no. If I ny and fight him to get away and he starts yelling, every nun
for a hundred miles around will come running.
"Don't go," he says. "It's too dangerous."
I know what he means. If the nuns see me sneaking out I'll be histow,
but I've got to risk it.
I pull myself out of Jankiel's grip.
"There are Nazis everywhere," he says.
"I know," I say. "That's why I have to go."
Jankiel screws up his face and stares at the floor.
"Look," he says, "I can't tell you what the Nazis are doing because
Mother Minka made me swear on the Bible that I wouldn't tell anyone. She
doesn't want everyone upset and worried."
"Thanks," I say. "But I know what they're doing. They're burning
books."
Jankiel looks like he's having a huge struggle inside himself. Finally he
gives a big sigh and his shoulders slump.
"Just don't go," he says. "You'll regret it if you do. Really regret it."
For the first time I feel a jab of fear.
I squash it.
"Thanks for the warning," I say. "That vivid imagination of yours is
going to be really helpful when you need to make up more stories."
He doesn't say anything. He can see I'm going.
